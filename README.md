🚀 DevTinder

💡 A platform for developers to connect, collaborate, and grow together.

📌 About

DevTinder is a developer-centric platform designed to help programmers find coding buddies, project partners, or simply connect with like-minded developers.

It’s built with a modern tech stack using TypeScript, React, Redux Toolkit, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to deliver a seamless and scalable developer networking experience.

🏗️ Project Architecture
